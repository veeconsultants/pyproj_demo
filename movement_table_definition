***** Special Instructions *****
1. Preference is to use Databricks (community edition if you do not have access to a Databricks account)
2. Store the results in a Delta table if using Databricks; otherwise, parquet table.
3. Create a row for each equipment.
4. All string fields should be trimmed of leading and trailing spaces with the exception of the train_ID (TrainID).
5. The event_datetime field should be adjusted for time zone based on the carrier_timezone value.  
   - If you are unable to do this adjustment then just use the event_datetime.
6. Multple splc fields exist.  Use the value from event.splc.
7. Only populate FromRoad and ToRoad if report_type (ReportType) is either 'ICHD' or 'ICHR'; otherwise, the fields should be null.
8. Any field not having a value (spaces) should be NULL.
9. structure of the source file
   - carrier and event data (applies to all equipment)
   -- v1.0.1: contains list of equipment to which this event applies
   --- interchange:  interchange information for the equipment (going from one railroad to another)
   --- various equipment fields
   --- waybill:  waybill data  (various information about the shipment)
   ---- waybill_parties:  list of waybill parties involved in the shipment
   ---- route:  list of route information
   ---- origin_station:  various information about the origin
   ---- destination_station:  various information about the destination
   ---- shipment_qualier:  identifies the type of shipment
